Public Arduino Projects

Here I have a small collection of (somewhat) useful Arduino projects that I would
Like to share with the public.  I have licensed these code snippits under the MIT
license for convenience of anyone that would like to use them for any purpose.

If you have any issues or questions about any of my projects, please contact me
at ko7m at arrl dot net and I will do my best to assist you.

Project list:

 - NTPClock - A simple time server synchronized Arduino clock
 - i2cscanner - Utility to show i2c devices attached to the i2c bus.
 - i2cscan    - A modification to scan all devices behind a PCA9546 i2c multiplexer
